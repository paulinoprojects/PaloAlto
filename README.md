# Palo Alto Networks Overview
## Intro ##
### Three Pillars of the Palo Alto Networks Portfolio
- **Network Security**: Protects networks with firewalls that can prevent threats.
- **Cloud Security**: Secures cloud environments, applications, and data.
- **Endpoint Security**: Protects devices like computers and mobile phones from malware and threats.

### Single-Pass Architecture
A design where the firewall processes all network traffic only once to inspect and secure it. This makes it faster and more efficient than processing the same traffic multiple times.

### Zero Trust Concept
This approach assumes no one, whether inside or outside the network, should be trusted by default. Every user or device must verify their identity before accessing any resource.

### Physical and Virtual Firewall Models
- **Physical Firewalls**: Hardware devices that protect your network from threats.
- **Virtual Firewalls**: Software-based firewalls that protect cloud environments or virtualized networks. They work like physical firewalls but on virtual machines.
