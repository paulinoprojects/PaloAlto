# Palo Alto Firewall Management and Configuration

## 1. Firewall Management Interfaces and Access Methods
- **Web Interface (GUI)**: Accessible via a browser by typing the firewall's management IP address. Provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for configuration.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Accessed via SSH or console cable. Used for advanced configuration and troubleshooting via command-line commands.
- **Panorama**: A centralized management system for multiple Palo Alto firewalls. Accessed via a web interface.
- **API**: Allows automated management and integration with other systems through RESTful calls.

## 2. Configure Firewall Management Interface Network Settings and Services
- **IP Address Configuration**: Set the management interface’s IP address via Web GUI or CLI (e.g., `set deviceconfig system ip-address` command).
- **Default Gateway**: Configure the default gateway for outbound traffic from the management interface.
- **DNS Settings**: Set DNS servers for domain name resolution in the Web GUI or CLI.
- **Services**: Enable or disable management services (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc.) under "Device" > "Management" settings in the Web GUI or using `set deviceconfig system services` CLI command.

## 3. Firewall Licenses and License Management
- **License Location**: Stored under "Device" > "Licenses" in the Web GUI or through CLI, linked to the device’s serial number and purchased features.
- **License Management**: Use the **Licensing Portal** (my.paloaltonetworks.com) to activate, renew, or manage licenses. In the Web GUI, go to "Device" > "Licenses" to check, install, or remove licenses.

    - Download the desired PAN-OS version or upload an update file.
    - Install the update and reboot the firewall.
- **CLI Update**:
